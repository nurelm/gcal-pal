> Find open time slots in your Google Calendar, so you can easily answer the question "When are you free to talk next week?"

A smart calendar availability finder that connects to your Google Calendar and intelligently identifies available time slots based on your working hours, lunch breaks, holidays, and customizable busy criteria. Perfect for scheduling meetings, finding focus time, or answering availability questions quickly.

**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [NuRelm](https://nurelm.com)**

## Features

-   Finds available time slots in any date range.
-   Defaults to finding time in the next week.
-   Considers your working hours and a daily lunch break.
-   Respects holidays from a specified Google Calendar (e.g., your company's holiday calendar) and a manual list of dates.
-   Intelligent busy detection with configurable criteria:
    -   Events with other attendees (meetings with colleagues)
    -   "Out of Office" events (vacation, sick days, etc.)
    -   Events of a specific color (for custom busy indicators)

## Setup

### 1. Enable the Google Calendar API

1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  Create a new project (or select an existing one).
3.  In the navigation menu, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
4.  Search for "Google Calendar API" and click **Enable**.

### 2. Create Credentials

1.  In the navigation menu, go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
2.  Click **Create Credentials** and choose **OAuth client ID**.
3.  If prompted, configure the consent screen. For the user type, select **External** and click **Create**.
4.  On the next screen, provide an app name (e.g., "Calendar Time Finder") and your email address. You can leave the other fields blank.
5.  For the application type, select **Desktop app** and click **Create**.
6.  A window will pop up with your client ID and client secret. Click the **Download JSON** button to download the credentials file.
7.  Rename the downloaded file to `credentials.json` and place it in the same directory as the script.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Finding Available Time

To find available time in the next week, simply run the script:

```bash
python gcal_pal.py
```

### Listing Available Colors

To list the available calendar colors, use the `--list-colors` argument:

```bash
python gcal_pal.py --list-colors
```

This will output a list of color IDs, their hex codes, and their English names. You can use these IDs to configure the `busy_criteria.consider_color_id` setting.

To find available time in a specific date range, use the `--start` and `--end` arguments:

```bash
python gcal_pal.py --start-date 2025-09-01 --end-date 2025-09-05
```

The first time you run the script, it will open a browser window to ask for permission to access your Google Calendar. After you grant permission, it will store the authorization token in a `token.json` file for future use.

### Example Output

```
Successfully connected to Google Calendar API.
Minimum meeting duration: 60 minutes

  - Consider attendees: true
  - Consider out of office: true
  - Consider color ID: 5
